summary: Recommended training and resources to learn AWS and the tools that DCA uses
---

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* AWS offers lots of free training to help you understand the various services and tools that they offer.  To create the [DCA architecture](), it would be beneficial to first complete the free [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (Second Edition)](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/) course.  To sign up the course, click on "Find a class near you" and sign up for an [AWS training](https://www.aws.training).  This is a short (6 hours) introductory course to AWS and is beneficial to both system administrators and non-technical users who want to know more about AWS.

## Other training resources
* [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) offers more hands-on training and curated learning paths (i.e. Data Scientist, Data Integration Specialist). AWS Educate offers $30 of free AWS credits
* [Quiklabs](https://run.qwiklabs.com) offers hands-on training for AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Quiklabs hands-on labs are generally more robust than what AWS Educate offers; for example, Quiklabs offers a Redshift lab where you analyze a dataset with more than 1 million records.
