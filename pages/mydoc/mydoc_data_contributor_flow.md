## Data Contributor Work Flow

The following process illustrates the process for submitting data as a data contributor. It closely follows the [Data Contributor Flow](https://data-commons-alpha.github.io/data-commons/mydoc_data_contributor_flow.html).  

## Contribution to Data Commons Steps 

(1) Complete, review, and sign legal agreement 

(2) Complete the data inventory form

(3) Receive project name and access credentials

(4) Prepare metadata and data dictionary 

(5) Access submission portal

(6) Submit and validate project metadata

(7) Get and configure s3 data storage credentials

(8) Upload "raw" data to object storage 

## Data Contributor to Data User

After uploading the data and metadata to the provided S3 storage bucket, if you wish to become a Data User, follow the Data User workflow.

## Upgrading

If you want to upgrade from an earlier version of the theme, I recommend that you download the new theme and copy of your Markdown files into the new theme. You'll then need to make adjustments to your page frontmatter, to the sidebar table of contents, links, image references, and alert references. In short, there's no easy upgrade path. But all of this won't take too long if you don't have mountains of content.
