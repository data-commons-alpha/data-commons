## About the Guidelines
The Data & Research  Guidelines are designed to optimize the performance of cloud resources and allow open use of the data.  If you desire for your research and data to be restricted, please follow the developer pipeline. 
1. Data commons co-locates data with cloud computing infrastructure and commonly used software services, tools & apps for managing, analyzing and sharing data to create an interoperable resource for the research community.
2. Data commons provide a platform for open data, open science and reproducible research that provide the data sharing infrastructure to support decision making.
3. The data is available to other researchers for discovery, which moves the research field faster.
