## Awesome Data Commons Stuffs goes here
The IVMF Research and Policy team will act as the Data Commons Service Provider and the Data Custodian. As the primary service provider, the team will serve as anchor to the Institute’s programs and services and empower government, private industry, higher education, and philanthropic organizations to effectively address today’s toughest challenges facing the veteran and military community. The team will accomplish this by developing, building, and establishing a Veterans Research Data Commons which will deliver insights and empower action to advance research and policy supporting America’s military-connected communities.
